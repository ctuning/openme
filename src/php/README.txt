This version is used to interface programs written in PHP
with Collective Knowledge Framework (CK). 

It is, in turn, included in current distribution of CK 
($CK_ROOT/repo/module/web/php) to connect CK 
with standard PHP-based web servers in Linux and Windows.

You can see example of such interfacing (to browse
CK repositories) here:
