OpenME
======
OpenME is a simple plugin-based event framework to decompose
complex software (tools, applications) into interconnected and 
shareable plugins. It is also used to connect user programs 
written in any language to Collective Knowledge (CK) framework 
and enable plugin-based auto-tuning and run-time adaptation 
(see our publications below describing the concept).

Currently, we support interfacing with C, C++, Fortran,
Java and PHP. Python is natively supported in Collective 
Knowledge framework.

The proof-of-concept (various auto-tuning version and Interactive 
Compilation Interface) has been successfully used in several academic 
and industrial projects since 1999, and has been eventually included 
to mainline GCC since version 4.6 (to enable interactive compilers 
and plugin-based auto-tuning combined with machine learning).

Java version of OpenME is used in Collective Mind Node to crowdsource
compiler auto-tuning using mobile phones:

Note, that we currently updating this version to work with the
new Collective Knowledge Framework. It may take some time, 
so please be patient!
