OpenME
======
OpenME is a simple plugin-based event framework to decompose
complex software (tools, applications) into interconnected and 
shareable plugins. It is also used to connect user programs 
written in any language to CK framework and enable plugin-based
auto-tuning and run-time adaptation (see our publications below 
describing the concept).

The proof-of-concept version (Interactive Compilation Interface)
has been successfully used in several academic and industrial
projects, and has been included to mainline GCC since version 4.6
(to enable interactive compilers and plugin-based auto-tuning
combined with machine learning).
